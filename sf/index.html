              One year after meeting over Manhattans at House of Shields,
              here we are: getting ready to eat some delicious food!
              Our destination for the night was Chez Panisse, a place Katherine walked
              past daily – but never dined at – during her three years living in Berkeley's Gourmet Ghetto.
            </p>
            <p>
              We both love good food, and we are looking forward to sharing it with you!

              When we were in Belgium (showing Katherine the pastures of my youth),
              I may have tricked her into going to Paris. The surprise was maintained until we got to the train platform in Brussels that said "PARIS".
            </p>
            <p>
              I did have one more surprise up my sleeve (no, not the ring, that was later and more of a team effort): lunch with our friend Jackie!
              (The <em>first</em> dessert was profiteroles at Caf&eacute; Constant, by the way!)

              Katherine and Adriaan met through OKCupid. Adriaan’s username was a_3_n (pronounce it a couple of times in your head until you hear "Adriaan").
              Rumor has it that it also refers to the three 'a's in his name.
            <p>
              Sooooo, if you were going to be nerdtastic and punny, how do you think you would spell out “Katherine”? Haaaa! Bingo.
            </p>
            <p>
              This picture was taken at Dear Mom's, when Jennifer was visiting, by the time we'd long stopped counting dates.
              On our second date, though, we went exploring the Sutro Baths and the Camera Obscura at Land’s End.
              Not long after that, Adriaan had successfully wooed Katherine with
              his gratin dauphinois, famous lasagne bolognese,
              and his secret weapon -- Belgian buckwheat pancakes with apple butter.
            </p>
            <p>
              Katherine soon found herself very full and very in love.

            <p>
              Last July, Katherine and Adriaan joined their friends for a weekend of camping and hiking in Yosemite National Park. Yosemite is probably one of
              Katherine's favorite places in the world, and after this trip, it became one of Adriaan's too. One of our hikes took us to the top of Upper
              Yosemite Falls, where the summer's slow trickle of water created natural pools 2,425 feet above the valley floor. </p>
            <p>
              Much frolicking, sunbathing,
              cannonballing, and epicry was enjoyed by all. In fact, as a game to keep moving forward on the steep hike up, we (including ourselves and our friends Ben and
              Shifumi) came up with an A to Z list of synonyms for "amazing". Naturally, bemazing came up.

              Gerard is an avid cyclist in his native province of Limburg, with its 1000 kilometers of beautiful bike lanes.
              Before he retired, he managed the IT infrastructure of the <a href="http://nl.wikipedia.org/wiki/Philips_(Hasselt)"
              tooltip="Did you know that the compact cassette was invented there in '62? They also produced the first CD player!" class="tooltip">Hasselt</a> plant of Philips.
              Adriaan and his dad spent a lot of time together programming the computers that were phased out at work.
              Gerard also built the home that Adriaan and his sister Anne-Katrien grew up in, providing Adriaan with his first taste of more <em>concrete</em> engineering work.

            <p>
              Marie-Mich&egrave;le is an expert flower arranger, choir singer and chef.
              During her professional career she helped immigrant women settle into Limburg,
              coordinating projects to teach them Dutch and other skills to help them feel at home and integrate into society.
              An important part of being Belgian is enjoying life through good food, and Marie-Mich&egrave;le taught Adriaan
              the essential skills of baking bread, making chocomousse and concocting all kinds of delicious appetizers (while eating most of them &ndash; a New Year's eve tradition).

              Douglas and Diane Loh and their daughter, Julia, live in College Station, Texas, where Katherine grew up. Doug is a retired professor of Texas A&amp;M
              University, where he taught courses in natural resource management, GIS mapping, and nonprofit management for almost 30 years. Katherine is not sure of his
              exact date of retirement though, since he seems to always still be working on some project or another.</p>
            <p>
              Katherine probably gets her love of delicious foods from Doug. He and Diane are masters of Chinese cooking and enjoying conjuring Chinese delicacies for their
              and their family's enjoyment. Diane is from the Chinese province of Inner Mongolia, and speaks both Mongolian and Mandarin. She loves soccer and
              can't wait for this summer's World Cup in Brazil.

              Rose and Steve Dillon live in Austin, Texas, where Katherine kept it weird while attending college at the University of Texas. Rose is a talented quilter
              extraordinaire and general fabric sorceress, and has four kids, one daughter-in-law, and a grandson upon whom to bestow her beautiful creations. </p>
            <p>Katherine probably gets all of her creativity, eye for color combination, and her dimples from Rose. Rose is also an increasingly attuned gardener, though Katherine
              would like to believe she had a hand in that. </p>
            <p>Steve is a lawyer with the Texas Department of Agriculture. Steve likes to kick back with a beer every now and
              then, but reserves trips to the Salt Lick (only the best Texas BBQ place ever) for when folks visit from out of town (or the occasional BBQ hankering).
